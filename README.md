# MY DEV-BLOG

## **WHAT THIS REPOSITORY IS?**

This repository contains the dev-blog project; my personal blog which I developed while learning coding at **powercoders**. The website has ~~three~~ two pages: a *the **home** page*, *the **about** page*, ~~and *the **posts** page*~~.

## **PAGES STRUCTURE**
The format is left simple, the three pages has the same headder and footer. The **headder** is fixed and contains a logo, a horizontal navigation bar, an image with caption, and social media logos links. The **footer** contains some credit.

1. ### THE HOME PAGE - ***index.html***:
    This page is the landing page. It shows three blog posts with an abstract for each post. The posts are either featured or most recent.

2. ### THE ABOUT PAGE - ***about.html***:
      This page contains three sections:
  - **About**<br>This section contains an elevator pitch, a professional photo, some contact infromation, and a button to download the full CV in pdf format.

   - **Career**<br>This section contains two parts; the ***employment history*** and the ***education history***, all in a timeline style.

   - **Skills**<br>This section contains three categories of skills; the ***management, business & organization skills***, the ***IT & technical skliss***, and the ***personal skills***. The skills are exhibited in a visual style (icons & illustrations).

3. ~~### THE POSTS PAGE - ***my-posts.html***:
    This page contains a chronological list of all posts along with the publishing date, and grouped by the year of publishing.~~

4. ### THE ARTICLES TEMPLATE - ***_post-template.html***:
    This is the main articles template, the **headder** includes only the logo and the navigation bar. Below the headder there is ~~a cover image,~~ the article title ~~, a caption,~~ and then the artcle text (the code).
